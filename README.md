## Simple menu with social links (HTML and CSS).

This is a simple menu without support for dropdown submenus. It has several styles and supports links to social media profiles. You can view a **demonstration** of this menu here: [Menu Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.net/simple-menu/). A demonstration of the menu in **Cyrillic** (*Russian language*) is available here: [Menu in Russian](https://demo.minimalweb.net/simple-menu/russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*Google fonts:* [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) (400, 400 Italic, 500, 500 Italic, 700, 700 Italic, 800).

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to use this menu if you want to add it to your project, since using this prefix will reduce the chance of conflicts with your project's styles.

### Thanks so much:

Created with **love** in 2023. Author: [Alexey Trofimov](https://minimalweb.net/). Feel free to use this menu in your projects ;)
